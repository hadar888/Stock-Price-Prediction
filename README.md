#Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This repository contains a Python implementation of a stock price prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The project aims to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

##Features
Data Retrieval: Download historical stock price data using the yfinance library.
Data Preprocessing: Extract relevant closing prices and scale them using MinMaxScaler.
Model Building: Construct an LSTM model using Keras.
Model Training: Train the LSTM model using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using root mean squared error (RMSE).
Visualization: Visualize the historical stock prices, predicted prices, and, if applicable, future predicted prices using matplotlib.

##Usage
Install the required dependencies: yfinance, matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, keras, and pandas.
Adjust the configuration constants in the code, such as stock symbol, date range, and prediction parameters.
Run the script to train the model, generate predictions, and evaluate its performance.
Examine the visualizations to gain insights into the predicted stock prices.
